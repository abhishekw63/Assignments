Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedural Programming (POP) are two different programming paradigms, each with its own approach to structuring code and solving problems. Here's a comparison of the two:

1. Paradigm:

OOP: OOP is based on the concept of objects and classes. It focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects and organizing code around these objects.
POP: POP is based on procedures or functions. It emphasizes writing code as a sequence of procedures or functions that manipulate data.
2. Data Organization:

OOP: In OOP, data and methods that operate on that data are encapsulated within objects. Objects bundle data and behavior together.
POP: In POP, data and functions are separate. Data is typically stored in data structures, and functions manipulate that data directly.
3. Reusability:

OOP: OOP promotes code reuse through the concept of inheritance. You can create new classes by inheriting attributes and methods from existing classes.
POP: Reusability in POP relies on functions or procedures that can be called from different parts of the program.
4. Focus:

OOP: OOP is more focused on modeling real-world objects and their relationships. It emphasizes concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
POP: POP is more focused on the sequence of steps needed to perform a task. It emphasizes procedural decomposition and modularization.
5. Complexity Handling:

OOP: OOP is often considered more suitable for handling complex systems because it allows you to model complex relationships and hierarchies.
POP: POP can work well for simpler tasks and smaller programs but may become less maintainable as complexity increases.
6. Examples:

OOP: Languages like Java, Python, and C++ are commonly used for OOP. For example, in Python, you create classes and objects to structure your code.
POP: Languages like C and Pascal are often associated with POP. In these languages, you typically write functions or procedures to perform tasks.
7. Use Cases:

OOP: OOP is well-suited for modeling real-world systems, building graphical user interfaces, and designing complex software with many interacting components.
POP: POP can be suitable for smaller programs, scripts, and situations where a straightforward sequence of steps is sufficient.
